      <p id="BadmintonInfo" class="info"> I love Badminton. I am playing badminton since 3 years. I used to play tennis but my sister started playing badminton, so I did too. Everyday I go for badminton coaching for 2 hrs. Even while exams are there Me and my sisters do not miss any class. I go to VKBA (Varun Khanwalkar Badminton Academy) for coaching. All the coaches there are super friendly and teach really nicely. On Saturday's there is a League known as Saturday league. It is like a tournament. I have played 3 tournaments(not saturday league). I have not won any but I have reached the quarter finals in the Amanora Tournament. I hope you enjoyed reading about my first hobby, don't forget to read about my second one. </p>

      <p class="info"> I love coding as well. I learn coding from WhiteHat Jr. I did my trial class on 24 August 2020. When I was small I wanted to make a app or game, but, my father told me that i need to learn coding for that. In 2020 I saw many ads of WhiteHat Jr and I really wanted to join it. I convinced my father a lot and then I joined! On September 2  2020 I joined WhiteHat Jr. It has been 7.5 Months since I started coding. Whenever I am free, I open my laptop and start coding. I also teach coding on my Youtube Channel - Code With Samiksha. Do Check it out!! </p>

          <h1> My favorite hobby </h1>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <h1> Badminton</h1>
          <h2> How popular is Badminton? </h2>
          <p> It may come as a surprise to some people that badminton is among the world's most popular sports. However, it is extremely popular and played regularly by an estimated 220 million people around the world. </p>
          <h2> Where is badminton most popular in the world? </h2>
          <p> In which countries around the world is badminton most popular? Of the 220 million people that regularly play badminton, a majority of those live in Asia, specifically in China and South Korea.</p>
          <h2> Who is the God of badminton?</h2>
          <p> Lin Dan
Born in Fujiyan China, Lin Dan (or Super Dan as his fans appropriately call him), is considered as the greatest of all players to have ever played the game of badminton. </p>
          <h1> Coding </h1>
          <h2> Why is coding becoming so popular? </h2>
          <p> Coding is important because computers are unable to interact with our native languages. They can only understand machine code which is in binary or hexadecimal. It is a coder's job to enable humans and machines to be able to "talk" to each other. </p>
          <h2> Can coding be fun?</h2>
          <p> Any person can enjoy coding. However, people who enjoy problem-solving often thrive as programmers. And while you don't have to have an 'engineering mind' to do well, you'll love coding if you also love building things. </p>
